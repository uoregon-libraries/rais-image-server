# Docker

This directory contains everything necessary to run RAIS under Docker,
including a test image for the compose-based demo.

## Building docker images

The easiest way to use these is from the parent directory's `Makefile` via
`make docker`.

## Running the demo

From the project root:

```bash
# Set up your local server's URL if "localhost" won't suffice for any reason
export URL=http://192.168.0.5

# Copy images into images/
cp /some/jp2/sources/*.jp2 ./docker/images/

# Run nginx and RAIS
docker compose up
```
